# Arabic words test for Year 1

### Algorithm
The algorithm is simple. It will select one word from collection to be the answer. It will also pull from collection another 5 different (not matching words). Question asked by word pronounceation in Arabic.    
I added picture just for better memorizing and visuals.    
      
This is example:     
<img src="./src/screen.png" />   

And this is example on smaller screens:       
<img src="./src/mobile.png" width="300"/> 

Even collection consists of more than 100 words, I added previous question check so the same word does not repeat few times.
